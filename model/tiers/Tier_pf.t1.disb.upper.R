#'  How to allocate total active and retiree numbers to tier 1 and tier 2


###' Service retirement 
#'  
#'  - Benefit rules
#'      - Use benefit rules of tier 1
#'      
#'    
#   - Eligibility for unreduced benefits
#'       - age 55 & yos 20
#'       - age 50 & yos 25
#'       - age 70
#'       - yos 30 
#'
#'  - Eligibility for reduced benefits
#'      - age 50 & yos 20
#'      - Reduction factors, use 7% for now, the same as tier 2, may be lower?
#'      - applied before the max benefit?
#'      
#'  - Vesting: 
#'       - ?
#'  
#'  
#'  - Final compensation (FAS) 
#'      - The plan policy
#'        - 12 highest consecutive months, with anti-spike measures. 
#'      - Model:
#'        - 1 year
#'  
#'  
#'  - Benefit formula
#'      - Police: 
#'          - factor: 2.5% per yos up to 20 years, plus 4% per yos in excess of 20
#'          - Max of 90% of FAS 
#'      - Fire: 
#'          - factor: If yos < 20, 2.5% per yos; if yos >= 20, 3% per yos
#'          - Max of 90% of FAS 
#'      - Model: combine police and fire




###' Deferred retirement  
#' - Plan  policy:
#'   - YOS < 10: Lump sum EEC with 2% annual interests
#'   - YOS >= 10, service retirement benefit, payable at the later of age 55 or 20 years since entry age
#'   
#' 
#  - Model: 
#'   - Simplification: reduced defrRet benefit for YOS < 10
#'   - for now reduce benefit by 50% if yos < 10



###' Disability retirement, service connected
#' 
#'  - Plan policy:
#'     - no age/yos requirement
#'     - Policy benefitï¼š50% of FAS + 4% per yos inexcess of 20, max 90% of FAS
#'     - Fire benefit:   yos < 20, 50% of FAS; yos >= 20, 3% per yos, max 90% of FAS 
#'        
#   - Model:
#'     - combine Policy and fire


###' Disability retirement, non-service connected
#'   - not modeled b/c all disabilities are assumed to be duty related in the AV 



# Death benefit: service connected
#   - Spouse:
#'    -  37.5% of FAS or 50% of servRet benefit
#'    -  max 42.5%(police) or 45% (fire) of FAS 
#'  - Eligible dependent children: 
#'    - additional 25% of FAS
#'  - Family total: max of 75% of FAS 
#'  
#'  - 50% death are assumed to be duty related


# Death benefit: non-service connected
#   - Less than 2 years of service: lump sum of EEC plus interest or $1000
#   - Disabled retirees or members ineligible for service retirement
#       - Spouse: 24% of FAS plus 0.75% of FAS per yos inexcess of 2, max 37.5% of FAS
#       - Children: 25% ~ 50% depending on the number
#       - family total less than 75% of FAS
#   - Service retirees or members eligible for service retirement
#       - Spouse: 37.5% of FAS or 50% of servRet, max 42.5% (police) or 45% (fire) of FAS
#       - Children: same as above
#       - family total less than 75% of FAS
#
#   -  Model: simplified 
#      -  assume lump sum of 3 x FAS   


# COLA:
#   - Policy: 3% 



###' Member contribution






## Assumptions, needs to be revisited 


#' Shares of police and fire members
#' Source: AV2019 ep43
#'  - police: 541 / 1215
#'  - fire: 674/1215

share_fire   <- 541/1215 # 44.5%
share_police <- 1 - share_fire  

# gender ratio:
# - No gender ratio provided in AV and CAFR, 
#   - Assumption: 10% female and 90% male
share_male <- 0.9
share_female <- 1 - share_male


## Assumptions on demographics 

#'  - SJPF tier 1 members
#'     - Police: hired before Aug 4, 2013
#'     - Fire  : hired before Jan 2, 2015
#'     
#'  How to allocate total active and retiree numbers to tier 1 and tier 2


# t1 and t2 mebmers:
#  Active members:
#   - According to AV2020 ep 46, there are 565 tier 2 members, and 1144 tier 1 members
#   - In AV2020 imputed demographic data, the number of actives with yos <= 5 is 551
#   - For now, use yos <= 5 as tier 2 members
#   - In theory, some tier 2 police members should have yos = 6 (6 11/12)?. Should 
#     keep this in mind. 
#
#
#  Serivice retirees for regular members
#    - According to AV2020 ep 30, there are no any type of retirees in tier 2
#
#
#  Initial terminated members
#   - For now, we assume that for each tier the liability of initial terminated members(in or not in pay status) 
#     is a fixed percentage of the AL of retirees. 
#   - As we assume the tier 2 has no retirees in the model, there are no AL for initial terminated members 
#     under the current simplification method. The should not be an issue because the actual AL for termianted should be 
#     very small as tier 2 is still new.
